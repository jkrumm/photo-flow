# Photo-Flow

A CLI tool for managing Fuji X-T4 camera photos/videos with a staging workflow for JPG photography with RAW backups, plus an optional gallery sync for high-rated images.

## Features

- Import photos and videos from Fuji X-T4 camera
- Manage workflow with staging and final folders for JPGs
- Backup RAW (.RAF) files
- Copy videos (.MOV) to external SSD
- Sync high-rated photos (rating ≥ 4) to a gallery with intelligent file handling
- Hash-based duplicate detection and post-copy verification
- Dry-run mode for import, cleanup, and sync-gallery
- Confirmation prompts for destructive actions
- Copy-first approach: only delete sources after verified copy
- Case-insensitive handling for .JPG/.RAF

## Quick Start

### 1. Install pipx (one-time setup)
```bash
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
source ~/.zshrc
```
### 2. Install Photo-Flow
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/photo-flow.git
cd photo-flow
pipx install -e .
```
### 3. Start using it anywhere!
```bash
photoflow status
photoflow import
photoflow finalize
photoflow cleanup
photoflow sync-gallery
```
That's it! No virtual environments to activate, works from any directory. ✨

## Commands

### `photoflow status`
Check the current status of your workflow:
- Camera connection status
- SSD connection status
- Pending files on camera (excluding JPGs already in Final)
- Files in staging area

### `photoflow import`
Import files from your camera:
- JPG files → Staging folder
- RAW files → RAWs backup folder
- Video files → External SSD

Add `--dry-run` to preview without copying files.

**Example:**
```bash
photoflow import --dry-run
photoflow import
```

### `photoflow finalize`
Move approved photos from staging to final folder:
- Moves photos to Final folder
- Copies them back to camera for viewing
- Removes orphaned RAW files (no matching JPG in Final)
- Cleans up RAW files from camera

Add `--dry-run` to preview without moving files.

**Example:**
```bash
photoflow finalize --dry-run
photoflow finalize
```

### `photoflow cleanup`
Remove unused RAW files that don’t have corresponding JPGs in the Final folder.

- Always previews first; asks for confirmation before deleting
- Use `--dry-run` to see only the preview and skip deletion

**Example:**
```bash
photoflow cleanup --dry-run
photoflow cleanup
```

### `photoflow sync-gallery`
Sync high-rated photos (4+ stars) to your gallery:
- Copies new high-rated images to gallery
- Updates changed images (using fast hash comparison)
- Removes images no longer rated 4+
- Generates metadata JSON
- Builds and syncs gallery to remote server

Add `--dry-run` to preview without syncing files.

**Example:**
```bash
photoflow sync-gallery --dry-run
photoflow sync-gallery
```

## Configuration

Edit paths in `photo_flow/config.py` to match your system:
```python
from pathlib import Path

CAMERA_PATH = Path("/Volumes/Fuji X-T4/DCIM")
STAGING_PATH = Path("/Users/johannes.krumm/Pictures/Staging")
RAWS_PATH = Path("/Users/johannes.krumm/Pictures/RAWs")
FINAL_PATH = Path("/Users/johannes.krumm/Pictures/Final")
SSD_PATH = Path("/Volumes/EXT/Videos/Videos")
GALLERY_PATH = Path("/Users/johannes.krumm/SourceRoot/photo-flow/photo_gallery/src")

EXTENSIONS = {'.JPG', '.RAF', '.MOV'}
```

### Prerequisites for gallery build/sync (optional)
- Node.js and npm (the workflow respects `.nvmrc` if present)
- rsync available on your system

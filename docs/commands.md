## Configuration System

photo-flow uses a three-level configuration system:

1. **Base Configuration** (`.photo-flowrc.js`)

   - Version controlled
   - Defines project defaults
   - Located in project root

2. **User Configuration** (`~/.photo-flow.json`)

   - User-specific settings
   - Not version controlled
   - Located in home directory

3. **Local Configuration** (`.photo-flow.local.json`)
   - Local environment overrides
   - Not version controlled (gitignored)
   - Located in project root

### Configuration Structure

#### Paths Configuration

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "camera": "/Volumes/Fuji X-T4/DCIM",
    "staging": "/Volumes/SSD/Photos/Staging",
    "archive": "/Volumes/HDD/Photos/Archive",
    "immich": "/Volumes/SSD/Photos/Immich"
  }
}
```

#### Network Configuration

```json
{
  "network": {
    "smbServer": "samba.jkrumm.dev",
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "********",
    "shares": [
      {
        "name": "HDD",
        "sharePath": "HDD",
        "mountPoint": "/Volumes/HDD"
      },
      {
        "name": "SSD",
        "sharePath": "SSD",
        "mountPoint": "/Volumes/SSD"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## SMB Mounting

photo-flow uses macOS's built-in SMB mounting via AppleScript for a reliable and user-friendly experience:

```applescript
mount volume "smb://user@server/share"
```

Benefits:

- Integrates with macOS Keychain for secure credential storage
- Provides native Finder integration
- Handles reconnection automatically
- Supports multiple shares from the same server

## Debug Mode

Add `--debug` to any command to see detailed information about:

- Project root detection
- Configuration file loading
- Configuration merging process
- Final configuration values

```bash
photo-flow --debug config list
photo-flow --debug config get paths.camera
```

### `photo-flow connect`

Connects to configured SMB shares using macOS's native mounting system.

```bash
photo-flow connect
```

Features:

- Uses native macOS SMB mounting via AppleScript
- Integrates with Keychain for secure credential storage
- Mounts all configured shares from `.photo-flowrc.js`
- Shows real-time progress with status indicators
- Verifies successful mounting of all shares

Example output:

```
System Status:
  üì∏  Camera   ‚úì Connected
  üîÑ  Staging  ‚úó Not Found
  üì¶  Archive  ‚úó Not Found
  üñºÔ∏è  Immich   ‚úì Connected
  üîå  SMB      ‚úó Disconnected
     HDD        ‚úó Not Mounted
     SSD        ‚úó Not Mounted

üì° Connecting to SMB shares...

  ‚úì Mounted HDD ‚Üí /Volumes/HDD
  ‚úì Mounted SSD ‚Üí /Volumes/SSD

‚ú® All shares mounted successfully!
```

The command will:

1. Check current mount status of all configured shares
2. Skip already mounted shares
3. Mount each unmounted share using AppleScript
4. Verify successful mounting
5. Show detailed status for any failed mounts

If any mounts fail, the command will:

- Show which shares failed to mount
- Display the mount point that was attempted
- Exit with status code 1
